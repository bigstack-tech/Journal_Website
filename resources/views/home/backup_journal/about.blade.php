        <h3>AIMS AND SCOPE</h3>
        <p>
            The African Journal of Hospitality, Tourism and Leisure (AJHTL) aims to publish interdisciplinary research that makes a clear contribution, theoretically or methodologically, to the body of knowledge relating to all aspects of tourism and hospitality within the Pan African context. AJHTL strives to publish first-rate academic articles in fields of human endeavour related to the core areas of hospitality, tourism and leisure. We offer the opportunity to publish research which is able to facilitate academic exchange and analysis in the international scientific community using open access publication as the vehicle. In a resource scares context which Africa finds itself, coupled with the changing dynamics of tourism in a rapidly complex global society, the AJHTL seeks to answer questions around tourism and hospitality that informs, public and private sector management, community development, policy and strategy development and implementation, sustainability and responsible behaviour amongst others.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the dynamic nature of the fields of hospitality, tourism and leisure,  AJHTL also accepts articles in the related fields of tourism geographies, marketing, management, economics, business ethics, corporate governance, stakeholder management, operations management, entrepreneurship, food and nutrition, service quality, sustainability and globalization. However, such articles should show a strong link on hospitality, tourism and leisure in Africa. Articles that do not link accordingly, or has a focus on Africa will not be considered.

        <h2>PEER REVIEW PROCESS</h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                The journal welcomes the submission of articles that satisfy the general criteria of significance and scientific excellence in the disciplines covered by its scope and will publish only original articles. The journal may include editorials as well as book reviews from time to time.
            </p>
            <p>
                All articles published in AJHTL are double-blind peer-reviewed by scholars who are experts in the subject/topic areas and in the discipline or methodological approach used. The main criterion for publication in AJHTL is that the paper must make a clear contribution substantively, theoretically or methodologically, to the body of knowledge as per journal scope.
            </p>
            <p>
                Submitted manuscripts are initially reviewed by the Editor in Chief for suitability. At this stage, the article is not fully reviewed but checked for compliance in terms of the journal scope, style and presentation. Articles rejected at this stage are those that have not met the journal requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject to submission of all required documents, and meeting all requirements, manuscripts are double-blind peer-reviewed by two independent expert readers in the field who remain anonymous throughout the process. Articles are only published if reports submitted to the journal are positive and if the author/s have made any revisions and/ or corrections which might have been deemed necessary. Articles are indexed in CrossRef and assigned a Digital Object Identifier (DOI).
            </p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>Our steps in the process: <br>
            Reviewers are asked to select one of the decisions regarding the submission as stated below:
        </h3>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Rejection: The manuscript is not accepted outright.</li>
                <li>Revise and resubmit: The manuscript is not accepted in its current form, but the author is encouraged to resubmit in the future after substantial changes have been made.</li>
                <li>Accept with minor revisions: The manuscript is accepted with only a few minor suggestions for improvement.</li>
                <li>accept with major revisions: The manuscript is accepted under the condition that the author revises the draft as stipulated by the reviewer and editors.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            Pharosjot reserves the right to reject the publication of any manuscript that fails to implement the suggested revisions. After the completion of revisions, the author must send a final electronic version to the editor in MS Word format. The final version must conform to the expected conventions outlined. Final drafts that fail follow the conventions will be returned to the author.  The editor will contact the author if there are any unresolved issues in the draft. If the content of the  passes initial editing, the author will be sent galley proofs when the typesetting is complete. If corrections are required, they should be corrected in the galley proofs and submitted to the editors by the deadline requested. The amount of time from submission to publication depends on numerous factors, but usually takes more or less 90 days.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our goal is to ensure a high standard of scholarship with an in-depth substantive review prior to all publication. Overall quality and originality is assessed in terms of structure, narrative, themes, methods and contribution to the body of knowledge. Authors may thus be expected to effect changes and make adaptations and revisions as stated above, where appropriate before publication of any manuscript. We provide open access so that articles are available to all to read and at no charge.

        <h2 style="color: orange">ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS</h2>
        <p>
            <b>The Editor</b> is required to act in a fair, balanced, objective manner and no discrimination of any sort is permitted or acceptable in any form or shape.All articles are required to considered if they align with the scope of the journal and are accepted solely on their academic merit and without commercial influence, after double blind peer review. All authors have a reasonable opportunity to respond to any complaints.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Reviewers</b> are appointed based on their expertise, to contribute to the decision-making process, thereby assist in improving the quality of the published article by reviewing the manuscript objectively and timeously. Reviewers are to maintain the confidentiality of any information supplied by the editor or author and may not retain or copy the manuscript in any way for any reason.The reviewers are expected to alert the editor or managing editor of any published or submitted content that is significantly similar to that under current review. Reviewers must state any concerns about conflicts of interest and alert the editor to these, if necessary withdrawing their services for reviewing a particular manuscript, which for example be from the same institution as the one in which they are employed
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>The Authors</b> are required to retain accurate records of data associated with their submitted manuscript, supply or provide access to any data referred to in an article, if requested request to do so. No article submitted may be under consideration or accepted for publication anywhere else. All sources must be cited accurately. The author/s must confirm that all the work in a submitted manuscript is original in nature and to acknowledge and cite content reproduced from other sources used. They also need to acquire permission to replicate any content from other sources. Authors must ensure that any studies involving human or animal subjects conforms to national, local and institutional laws and requirements (e.g. WMA Declaration of Helsinki,) and confirm that approval has been sought and obtained where appropriate from university research ethics committees or other legal bodies. Authors must ensure that the well-being, safety and protection of persons involved in the research, where applicable, is of primary concern. Potential conflicts of interest must be disclosed. Where errors may occur in publication, the author/s should notify the editor and necessary revisions will be made and an erratum published. Where deemed necessary, an article may be retracted.
            <br>
            Misconduct and unethical behaviour, if and when identified, must be brought to the attention of the editor and publisher. Minor misconduct will be dealt with rapidly and a â€˜guiltyâ€™ party can respond electronically to establish their case in a collegial fashion. Any informant should also be collegial and provide sufficient information and evidence of error or intentional oversight, in order for an investigation to be initiated. All allegations are taken seriously and treated in the same way, until a successful decision or conclusion is reached. Evidence must be presented and no allegations will be made beyond those who need to know. The editor may consult with experts for advice and his/her decision will be binding. Where there has been misconduct, there will be a formal notice detailing the misconduct and the outcome thereof.

            <h2>Cautionary <br> Authorship</h2>
            <p>
                Inclusion/s of a person/s who were not involved in the writing of a manuscript is a violation of publication ethics.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Plagiarism</h2>
            <p>
                Submitted manuscripts must be the original works of the author(s). This why we require a plagiarism report such as Turnitin for each manuscript.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Duplicate Manuscript</h2>
            <p>
                It is highly unethical for authors to submit a manuscript to more than one journal simultaneously. This includes the submission of any manuscripts derived from the same data in such a manner that there are clearly no substantial differences in the submission. Submitting the same article in a different languages to another journal is also unethical.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Fabrication / Falsification of Data</h2>
            <p>
                Fabrication, manipulation or falsification of data is a severe violation of publication ethics. Where there is suspicion of  false or fabricated data, legal steps may be taken against authors.

        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Citation Manipulation</h2>
            <p>Only articles/sources relevant to the article must be cited.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h2>Data Protection</h2>
            <p>
                In terms of the Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA or the Act), No. 4 of 2013, for an author/s submitting a manuscript to us for reviewing for our publications, we require name, email address, Orcid ID (Where applicable), institutional affiliation and country. These are used for the regular operations of a publication. The publication and the publisher recognize the importance of protecting the personal information collected from users in the operation of article publication, and have practices in place to ensure that steps are taken to maintain the security, integrity, and privacy of the personal data collected and processed. Where quantitative data has been collected, and in some cases qualitative or mixed methodology data, (unless totally conceptual desktop research) an ethical clearance attainment statement from institutions must be stated in the article by the author/s. All details on record are destroyed after 3 years. Except of course for what appears on the online article.

            <li>
                -Any paper submitted to a journal should only be considered for possible publication
                if the author(s) have certified that the paper in question is not under consideration by
                another publication, and will not be submitted to any other journal until a final
                rejection decision (or formal withdrawal) from the present journal has been received.

            </li>
            <li>
                -The existing relevant literature must be appropriately and fairly cited, and self-citation
                must be limited; in this respect, efforts should be made to ensure that reference is
                made to the first report of a finding or conceptual insight, if possible, rather than a
                later citation with reference to subsequent work.
            </li>
            <li>
                -Authorship must conform to the notions of responsibility and credit; thus special
                attention must be given to the first â€˜leadâ€™ author (sometimes explicitly shared), and
                the inclusion in the authorship listing only of persons who have made a significant
                contribution to the production of the work at an intellectual, practical or conceptual
                level.
                Speculative decisions and statements must be clearly specified as such and kept to
                a minimum (except where the nature of the contribution requires speculation, such
                as philosophical articles, case discussions, theology, etc.).

                -Author affiliations should be provided which reflect both the period of the study and

            </li>
            <li>
                -Priority is given from the date of acceptance of an article (i.e. once the peer review
                has already taken place), not from its date of receipt. However both dates are
                always provided in the published version.
            </li>
            <li>
                -Post-publication errors and falsifications must always be corrected and/or retracted
                in a later issue of the same journal by means of an erratum or a retraction notice
                which should be published on the article HTML/website page as well as the PDF.
